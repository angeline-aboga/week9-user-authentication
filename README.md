# Week 8: Data Persistence Using Firebase

**Name:** Trisha Angeline R. Aboga <br/>
**Section:** U-1L <br/>
**Student number:** 2022 - 04177 <br/>

## Code Description

Added authentication, form fields in signup, and text field highlight during form validation to the todos app.

## Things you did in the code

I just added what I learned from Week 4.

## Challenges encountered

Fixing the uploaded code based on the handout caused a major error. It seemingly works fine but after successfully signing up/in, the app gets stuck with the circular progress indicator. To be able to see the added widgets and validators, I had to comment out the todos builder which is a massive handicap since it confused me a lot and took a lot of time. I don't know how to fix it.
